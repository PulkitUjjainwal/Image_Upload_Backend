# Sleep Tracker API

This repository contains the code for the Sleep Tracker API, which is designed to manage sleep records for users.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/88h88h/Backend-assignment-sleep-tracker.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the root directory:

```bash
cd Backend-assignment-sleep-tracker
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
#### 4. Setup MongoDB Database with Database Name 'SleepDB' and collection name 'records'

#### 5. Make a '.env.development' in the root directory and write in it

```bash 
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=WRITE_YOUR_MONGO_URI
```

#### 6. Run the server:

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

The server should now be running on 

```bash 
http://localhost:5000. 
```
and the APIs can be accessed through 

```bash 
http://localhost:5000/api. 
```

## Testing

- Make a test database 'sleepDB_test' with a collection named 'records' 

- Make a '.env.test' in the root directory and write in it

```bash 
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=WRITE_YOUR_TEST_DB_MONGO_URI
```

The test file 'api.test.js' is provided in the 'test' folder of the root directory. 

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
